### COURSE-1: Artificial Intelligence Algorithms Models and Limitations (LearnQuest) [(coursel ink)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-algorithm-limitations)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### WEEK-1: Getting Started: Algorithms.

&nbsp;

##### Knowledge Check Quiz:

1) True
2) feedback loop
3) No, due to combining data and re-identification

##### Weekly Quiz:

1) a recipe that a computer uses to solve problems
2) learning algorithm.
3) Scan to find the smallest number.

   Set to 0 in the index in the output array.

   Remove that number from the input array.

   Repeat steps 1-3, but add 1 to the index number for each loop.
4) An basic algorithm takes an input and gets an output, while a learning algorithm uses the output on the next input.
5) An explainable description of code that is meant for humans, not computers.
6) Learning algorithms require large datasets, which means storing identifying information about users.
7) Anonymized datasets can be combined with other datasets, which can re-identify individuals.
8) Collecting location data every time the app is opened, potentially learning where a user lives, works, etc.
9) A social media site tracks engagement, uses an algorithm to surface posts you're likely to engage with, which then goes back into the algorithm.
10) Even if you haven't shared an direct datapoint about yourself, with enough related datapoints the algorithm can make an educated guess with alarming accuracy.
